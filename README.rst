About this repository
+++++++++++++++++++++

This repository holds a fork of the `"Materials Data Curation System (MDCS)" <https://github.com/usnistgov/mdcs/>`_
that has been customized for use as part of the NexusLIMS laboratory information management system (see the
`published manuscript <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621000222>`_ for more details about NexusLIMS). This repository
contains the "front-end" system that gives users access to experimental XML records built by the 
`NexusLIMS backend <https://github.com/usnistgov/NexusLIMS>`_.

The software was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the standard NIST license
and disclaimer apply (see the ``LICENSE.txt`` file for details).

Updates
+++++++

In general, the NexusLIMS developers strive to keep this code up-to-date with the "upstream" version of
`MDCS <https://github.com/usnistgov/mdcs>`_, although it may lag behind by a version or two at times due to the
development effort required to integrate upstream changes.

Installation
++++++++++++

It is recommended to deploy this application as described in the
`NexusLIMS Docker Deployment <https://github.com/usnistgov/nexuslims-cdcs-docker>`_ repository. For further details and
suggestions for deployment, please see that repository.

Values to customize
+++++++++++++++++++

A few values in this code have placeholders in order to make it less-specific to the NIST deployment environment. As
a result, there are a couple places where values should be changed (either by the Docker deployment scripts, or
manually) in order to get a working installation. The following table (potentially non-exhaustive) contains values you
should or might want to change in order to customize the application to your specific needs:

| ``xslt/detail_stylesheet.xsl`` | ``datasetBaseUrl``      | This ``<xsl:variable>`` value (and the others below) are  |
|                                |                         | used to control the target of certain links on the HTML   |

|                                |                         | ``datasetBaseUrl`` should be a web-accessible path to the |
|                                |                         | root of the file structure (i.e. all ``location`` nodes   |
|                                |                         | within a record's XML will be appended to                 |

|                                |                         | page. This could be the same as ``datasetBaseUrl`` if     |
|                                |                         | the files are all in the same location, but is separated  |

|                                |                         | at this point).                                           |
