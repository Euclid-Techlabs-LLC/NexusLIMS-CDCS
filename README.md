# NexusLIMS CDCS

This branch (`NexusLIMS_master_internal`) of the repository is reserved for internal-specific configuration
that will not be pushed to the public repository on Github. This file was created as a way to prevent an accidental
push to a branch with this name on Github.

If you got here by accident, you're probably looking for the default branch, named `NexusLIMS_master`. Visiting
https://github.com/usnistgov/NexusLIMS-cdcs should get you there.
